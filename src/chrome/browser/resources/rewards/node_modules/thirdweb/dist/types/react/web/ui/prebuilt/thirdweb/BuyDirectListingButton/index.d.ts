 * This button is used with thirdweb Marketplace v3 contract, for buying NFT(s) from a listing.
 *
 * Under the hood, it prepares a transaction using the [`buyFromListing` extension](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/marketplace/buyFromListing)
 * and then pass it to a <TransactionButton />
 *
 * Since it uses the TransactionButton, it can take in any props that can be passed
 * to the [`TransactionButton`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/TransactionButton)
 *
 *
 * @param props
 * @returns <TransactionButton />
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { BuyDirectListingButton } from "thirdweb/react";
 *
 * <BuyDirectListingButton
 *   contractAddress="0x..." // contract address of the marketplace v3
 *   chain={...} // the chain which the marketplace contract is deployed on
 *   client={...} // thirdweb client
 *   listingId={100n} // the listingId or the item you want to buy
 *   quantity={1n} // optional - see the docs to learn more
 * >
 *   Buy NFT
 * </BuyDirectListingButton>
 * ```
 *
 * For error handling & callbacks on transaction-sent and transaction-confirmed,
 * please refer to the TransactionButton docs.
 * @component
