/**
 * Retrieves events from a contract based on the provided options.
 * @param options - The options for retrieving events.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an array of parsed event logs.
 * Note: toBlock and fromBlock are both inclusive.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { getContractEvents } from "thirdweb";
 * const events = await getContractEvents({
 *  contract: myContract,
 *  fromBlock: 123456n,
 *  toBlock: 123456n,
 *  events: [preparedEvent, preparedEvent2],
 * });
 * ```
 * @example
 * Optionally specify a blockRange as the number of blocks to retrieve. toBlock will default to the current block number.
 * ```ts
 * import { getContractEvents } from "thirdweb";
 * const events = await getContractEvents({
 *  contract: myContract,
 *  blockRange: 123456n,
 *  events: [preparedEvent, preparedEvent2],
 * });
 * ```
 * @example
 * Use fromBlock with blockRange for pagination.
 * ```ts
 * import { getContractEvents } from "thirdweb";
 * const events = await getContractEvents({
 *  contract: myContract,
 *  fromBlock: lastBlockFetched,
 *  blockRange: 123456n,
 *  events: [preparedEvent, preparedEvent2],
 * });
 * ```
 * @example
 * Retrieve events for a specific block hash.
 * ```ts
 * import { getContractEvents } from "thirdweb";
 * const events = await getContractEvents({
 *  contract: myContract,
 *  blockHash: "0x...",
 *  events: [preparedEvent, preparedEvent2],
 * });
 * ```
