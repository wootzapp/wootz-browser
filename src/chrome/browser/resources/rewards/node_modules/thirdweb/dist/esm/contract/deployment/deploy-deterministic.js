 * Deploy a contract deterministically - will maintain the same address across chains.
 * This is meant to be used with published contracts configured with the 'direct deploy' method.
 * Under the hood, this uses a keyless transaction with a common create2 factory.
 * @param options - the options to deploy the contract
 * @returns - the transaction to deploy the contract
 * @extension DEPLOY
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { prepareDeterministicDeployTransaction } from "thirdweb/deploys";
 * import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";
 *
 * const tx = prepareDeterministicDeployTransaction({
 *  client,
 *  chain: sepolia,
 *  contractId: "AccountFactory",
 *  constructorParams: [123],
 * });
 * ```
