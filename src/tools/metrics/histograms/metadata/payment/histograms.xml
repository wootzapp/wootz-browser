<histogram name="PaymentRequest.CheckoutFunnel"
    enum="PaymentRequestCheckoutFunnelSteps" expires_after="2024-11-03">
  <owner>rouslan@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>web-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts the number of Payment Requests (PR) that go through each checkout
    step. A single PR may be counted in multiple buckets depending on its final
    status. e.g. A completed PR will be counted in all of the following buckets
    1- Initiated, 2- show() called 3- Payment request triggered 4- Payment
    handler invoked, 5- Completed.

<histogram name="PaymentRequest.EventResponse.CanMakePayment" enum="Boolean"
    expires_after="2024-02-20">
  <owner>rouslan@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>web-payments-team@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    A payment handler's response to the &quot;canmakepayment&quot; event in its
    service worker. The event is fired when &quot;new PaymentRequest()&quot; is
    called in JavaScript, but only for URL-based payment methods, only for
    already installed payment handlers, and only when not in private browsing
    mode. The response from &quot;canmakepayment&quot; is expected to be
    &quot;true&quot; in the majority of cases. The value of &quot;false&quot;
    could be either the payment handler refusing to make payments or an internal
    error, which should both be rare.
