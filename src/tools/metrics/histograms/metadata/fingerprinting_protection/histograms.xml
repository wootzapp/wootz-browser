  <owner>thesalsa@google.com</owner>
  <owner>trishalfonso@google.com</owner>

  <summary>
    Records the total time a child frame navigation was delayed while
    calculating whether it should be disallowed or not. Logged for all
    navigations that were marked {Result}.

    This metric uses UMA_HISTOGRAM_CUSTOM_MICROSECONDS_TIMES to acccount for
    clients with low-resolution clocks.

<histogram name="FingerprintingProtection.IndexRuleset.NumUnsupportedRules"
    units="rules" expires_after="2025-04-30">
  <owner>rizvis@google.com</owner>
  <owner>thesalsa@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The number of rules that could be not be successfully indexed and therefore
    have been ignored. Recorded every time the RulesetService kicks off a
    ruleset indexing process and it reaches the point where rules are getting
    indexed. This is logged when a new ruleset is indexed for the first time on
    Chrome start for Fingerprinting Protection.

<histogram name="FingerprintingProtection.PageLoad.ActivationDecision"

  <owner>thesalsa@google.com</owner>
  <owner>trishalfonso@google.com</owner>
  <owner>rizvis@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the ActivationDecision computed by the
    FingerprintingProtectionPageActivationThrottle, considering the tracking
    protection content setting values, on the navigation. Computed once in
    WillProcessResponse, before committing the navigation.
  </summary>

  <summary>
    Records the ActivationLevel computed by the
    FingerprintingProtectionPageActivationThrottle, considering the tracking
    protection content setting values, on the navigation. Computed once in
    WillProcessResponse, before committing the navigation.

  <owner>thesalsa@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether indexing a version of the ruleset and writing it to disk succeeded,
    or failed at a particular step. Recorded every time the RulesetService kicks
    off a ruleset indexing process for Fingerprinting Protection.
