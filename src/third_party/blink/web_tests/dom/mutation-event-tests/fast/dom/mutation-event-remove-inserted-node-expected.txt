Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a large risk of future site breakage. Consider using MutationObserver instead. See https://chromestatus.com/feature/5083947249172480 for more information.
This test verifies that a mutation event that removes inserted nodes from the document doesn't crash upon the insertion of a new node into the document.
