This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Repeated declarative shadow roots keep only the first
  assert_equals: expected "Open" but got "Closed"
[FAIL] Calling attachShadow() on declarative shadow root must match mode
  assert_throws_dom: Mismatched shadow root mode should throw function "() => {\n    open1.attachShadow({mode: "closed"});\n  }" did not throw
[FAIL] Calling attachShadow() on declarative shadow root must match all parameters
  assert_throws_dom: Mismatched shadow root mode should throw function "() => {\n    open2.attachShadow({mode: "closed"});\n  }" did not throw
Harness: the test ran to completion.
