This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] All properties (except 'all') can serialize their initial value (computed)
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid", "none / none / none / row / auto / auto"], ["page-orientation", ""], ["popover-hide-delay", "infinity * 1s"], ["position-try", "normal"], ["size", ""]] length 5
[FAIL] All properties (except 'all') can serialize their initial value (specified)
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid-column-gap", "normal", ""], ["grid-gap", "normal normal", ""], ["grid-row-gap", "normal", ""]] length 3
[FAIL] All shorthands (except 'all') can serialize their longhands set to their initial value
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["border", ""], ["grid-gap", ""]] length 2
[FAIL] All aliases can serialize target property set to its initial value
  assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array [] length 0, got [["grid-column-gap", ""], ["grid-row-gap", ""]] length 2
Harness: the test ran to completion.
