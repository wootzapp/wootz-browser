[FAIL] list-style-image uses discrete animation when animating between "url("http://localhost/test-1")" and "url("http://localhost/test-2")" with linear easing
  assert_equals: The value should be url("http://localhost/test-1") at 499ms expected "url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\")" but got "cross-fade(url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\") 50.1%, url(\\"http://localhost/test-2\\"))"
[FAIL] list-style-image uses discrete animation when animating between "url("http://localhost/test-1")" and "url("http://localhost/test-2")" with effect easing
  assert_equals: The value should be url("http://localhost/test-1") at 940ms expected "url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\")" but got "cross-fade(url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\") 57.1741%, url(\\"http://localhost/test-2\\"))"

  assert_equals: The value should be url("http://localhost/test-1") at 940ms expected "url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\")" but got "cross-fade(url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\") 57.1741%, url(\\"http://localhost/test-2\\"))"
[FAIL] word-spacing supports animating as a percentage
  assert_equals: The value should be 30% at 500ms expected "30%" but got "0px"
[FAIL] word-spacing supports animating as combination units "px" and "%"
  assert_equals: The value should be calc(10% + 5px) at 500ms expected "calc(10% + 5px)" but got "5px"
[FAIL] word-spacing supports animating as combination units "%" and "em"
  assert_equals: The value should be calc(5% + 10px) at 500ms expected "calc(5% + 10px)" but got "10px"
[FAIL] word-spacing supports animating as combination units "px" and "calc"
  assert_equals: The value should be calc(10% + 10px) at 500ms expected "calc(10% + 10px)" but got "5px"
