[FAIL] background-image uses discrete animation when animating between "url("http://localhost/test-1")" and "url("http://localhost/test-2")" with linear easing
  assert_equals: The value should be url("http://localhost/test-1") at 499ms expected "url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\")" but got "cross-fade(url(\\"http://localhost/test-1\\") 50.1%, url(\\"http://localhost/test-2\\"))"
