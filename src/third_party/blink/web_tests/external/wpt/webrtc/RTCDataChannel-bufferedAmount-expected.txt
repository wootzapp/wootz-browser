This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] datachannel bufferedAmount should increase to size of blob sent
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
[FAIL] datachannel bufferedAmount should stay at zero for empty blob sent
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
[FAIL] datachannel bufferedAmount should increase by byte length for each message sent
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
[FAIL] negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount should increase to size of blob sent
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
[FAIL] negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount should stay at zero for empty blob sent
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
[FAIL] negotiated datachannel bufferedAmount should increase by byte length for each message sent
