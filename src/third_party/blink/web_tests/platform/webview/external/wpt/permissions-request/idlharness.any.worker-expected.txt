This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Permissions interface: operation request(object)
  assert_own_property: self does not have own property "Permissions" expected property "Permissions" missing
[FAIL] Permissions interface: navigator.permissions must inherit property "request(object)" with the proper type
  assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
[FAIL] Permissions interface: calling request(object) on navigator.permissions with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_equals: wrong typeof object expected "object" but got "undefined"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
