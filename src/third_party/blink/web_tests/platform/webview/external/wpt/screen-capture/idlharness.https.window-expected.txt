[FAIL] CaptureController interface: existence and properties of interface object
  assert_own_property: self does not have own property "CaptureController" expected property "CaptureController" missing
[FAIL] CaptureController interface object length
  assert_own_property: self does not have own property "CaptureController" expected property "CaptureController" missing
[FAIL] CaptureController interface object name
  assert_own_property: self does not have own property "CaptureController" expected property "CaptureController" missing
[FAIL] CaptureController interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
  assert_own_property: self does not have own property "CaptureController" expected property "CaptureController" missing

[FAIL] MediaDevices interface: operation getDisplayMedia(optional DisplayMediaStreamOptions)
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "getDisplayMedia" missing
[FAIL] MediaDevices interface: navigator.mediaDevices must inherit property "getDisplayMedia(optional DisplayMediaStreamOptions)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "getDisplayMedia" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] MediaDevices interface: calling getDisplayMedia(optional DisplayMediaStreamOptions) on navigator.mediaDevices with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "getDisplayMedia" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
