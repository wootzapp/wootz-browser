This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] mouse click target during capture
  assert_equals: An element should only receive click when it is the first common ancestor of pointerdown and pointerup targets expected "pointerdown@green,gotpointercapture@blue,pointerup@blue,click@blue,lostpointercapture@blue" but got "pointerdown@green,gotpointercapture@blue,pointerup@blue,click@grey,lostpointercapture@blue"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
