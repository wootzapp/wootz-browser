This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Test drawImage with imageSmoothingEnabled=false and scaling down the source.
  assert_array_equals: drawImage() should have the same results with imageSmoothingEnabled = true and false when scaling down. expected property 3 to be 127 but got 128 (expected array object "255,0,0,127,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0" got object "255,0,0,128,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0")
Harness: the test ran to completion.
