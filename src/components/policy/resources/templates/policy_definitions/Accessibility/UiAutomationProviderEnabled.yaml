caption: Enable the browser's UI Automation accessibility framework provider on
  Windows
desc: |-
  Enables the UI Automation accessibility framework provider in
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> for use by accessibility
  tools.

  This policy is supported in
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> for a one-year
  transition period to allow enterprise administrators to control the deployment
  of the browser's UI Automation accessibility framework provider. Accessibility
  and other tools that use the UI Automation accessibility framework to
  interoperate with the browser may require updates to function properly with
  the browser's UI Automation provider. Administrators can use this policy to
  temporarily disable the browser's UI Automation provider (thereby reverting to
  the old behavior) while they work with vendors to provide updates to impacted
  tools.

  When set to false, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> only
  enables its Microsoft Active Accessibility provider. Accessibility and other
  tools that use the newer UI Automation accessibility framework to interoperate
  with the browser will communicate with it by way of a compatibility shim in
  <ph name="MS_WIN_NAME">Microsoft® Windows®</ph>.

  When set to true, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>
  enables its UI Automation provider in addition to its Microsoft Active
  Accessibility provider. Accessibility and other tools that use the newer UI
  Automation accessibility framework to interoperate with the browser will
  communicate directly with it.

  When left unset, the variations framework in <ph
  name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> is used to enable or disable
  the provider.

  Support for this policy setting will end in <ph
  name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> 136.
