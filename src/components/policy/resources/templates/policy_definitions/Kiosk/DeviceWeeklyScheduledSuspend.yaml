caption: Schedule weekly suspend intervals
desc: |-
  This policy establishes a series of weekly intervals for scheduling automated suspension. When an interval starts, the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> device will enter suspend mode, and wake up when the interval ends.

  Schedules with overlapping intervals are not supported. This policy will not have any effect if it contains any two overlapping intervals.

  <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> devices will use the system timezone to apply these intervals.
