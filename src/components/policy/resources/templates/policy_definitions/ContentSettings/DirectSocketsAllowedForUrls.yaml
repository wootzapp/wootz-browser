caption: Allow Direct Sockets API on these sites
desc: |-
  The Direct Sockets API allows communication with arbitrary endpoints using TCP and UDP.
  Please see https://github.com/WICG/direct-sockets for details.

  Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites are allowed to use Direct Sockets API.
  These may include Chrome Apps, Isolated Web Apps and Web Kiosks; the API is never available on the open web.

  Leaving the policy unset means <ph name="DEFAULT_DIRECT_SOCKETS_SETTING_POLICY_NAME">DefaultDirectSocketsSetting</ph> applies for all sites, if it's set.

  URL patterns must not conflict with <ph name="DIRECT_SOCKETS_BLOCKED_FOR_URLS_POLICY_NAME">DirectSocketsBlockedForUrls</ph>. Neither policy takes precedence if a URL matches with both.

  For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. <ph name="WILDCARD_VALUE">*</ph> is not an accepted value for this policy.
