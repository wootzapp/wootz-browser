caption: Control use of the Direct Sockets API
default: null
desc: |-
  The Direct Sockets API allows communication with arbitrary endpoints using TCP and UDP.
  Please see https://github.com/WICG/direct-sockets for details.

  Setting the policy to 1 allows qualifying origins to use Direct Sockets.
  These include Chrome Apps, Isolated Web Apps and Web Kiosks; the API is never available on the open web.

  Setting the policy to 2 blocks origins from using Direct Sockets.

  Leaving it unset allows Direct Sockets.
