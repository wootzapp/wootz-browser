## ⚔️ Kill The Wallet

- 👐 **Open Source**. We have the exact same license as Metamask
- 🎁 **No Extensions**. Just use the damn browser!
- 🙈 **Privacy First**. Not even ads.
- 🔐 **Cryptographic storage**. We use [Flutter Secure Store](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) for secure storage on mobile. On Android and ios, it uses the native encrypted storage (like secure enclave)

## 🪅 Getting Started

1. It's Flutter!

## 🧐 Contributing Guidelines (There is only one)

This project hopes and requests for clean pull request merges. the way we merge is squash and merge. This fundamentally can only work if you **NEVER ISSUE A PULL REQUEST TWICE FROM THE SAME LOCAL BRANCH**. If you create another pull request from same local branch, then the merge will always fail.

solution is simple - **ONE BRANCH PER PULL REQUEST**. We Follow this strictly. if you have created this pull request using your master/main branch, then follow these steps to fix it:
```
# Note: Any changes not committed will be lost.
git branch newbranch      # Create a new branch, saving the desired commits
git checkout master       # checkout master, this is the place you want to go back (which will be same as the last commit in WootzApp main repo)
git reset --hard HEAD~3   # Move master back by 3 commits (Make sure you know how many commits you need to go back)
git checkout newbranch    # Go to the new branch that still has the desired commits. NOW CREATE A PULL REQUEST
```

## 📜 License

WootzApp is open-source OSS software. We are not lawyers, hence we have adopted the exact same license that Metamask does. Their reasoning is mentioned here - https://medium.com/metamask/evolving-our-license-for-the-next-wave-of-metamask-users-81b0b494c09a
